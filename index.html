            <h2>What is the Mark of the Beast?</h2>
            
            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 13:16-17 (KJV)</span>
                "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Important:</strong> The mark of the beast is NOT a physical chip or tattoo. It is a <strong>symbolic mark</strong> representing allegiance to a religious-political system that opposes God's commandments.
            </div>

            <h3>Why the Mark is Symbolic, Not Physical</h3>

            <p>Throughout the Bible, God uses "mark on forehead/hand" as symbolic language for obedience and loyalty. This pattern appears repeatedly in the Old Testament:</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Deuteronomy 6:6-8 (KJV)</span>
                "And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart... And thou shalt <strong>bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> God commanded Israel to keep His words in their hearts and bind them as a "sign" on their hands and foreheads. This was clearly symbolic - God never intended literal bands or tattoos! The "hand" represents actions/obedience, and "forehead/between eyes" represents thoughts/beliefs. This shows us the biblical pattern for understanding Revelation's mark.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Deuteronomy 11:18 (KJV)</span>
                "Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and <strong>bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Again, God's Word should be in our hearts (beliefs) and displayed in our hands (actions). No ancient Israelite walked around with physical bands on their foreheads! This metaphor teaches that God's truth should govern our thinking and doing.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Exodus 13:9 (KJV)</span>
                "And it shall be for <strong>a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes</strong>, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Passover observance was to be as a "sign" on the hand and "memorial" between the eyes. This connects God's law with symbolic marks on hand and forehead - showing these represent obedience to God's commands, not physical marks.</p>

            <h3>God's People Also Receive a "Mark" - On Their Foreheads!</h3>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Ezekiel 9:4 (KJV)</span>
                "And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and <strong>set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations</strong> that be done in the midst thereof."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> God commanded His angel to place a protective "mark" on the foreheads of the righteous who grieved over sin. This mark distinguished them from the wicked. Was this a physical tattoo? No! It symbolized God's recognition of their spiritual loyalty and character. Similarly, the beast's mark represents spiritual allegiance to a false system.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 7:3 (KJV)</span>
                "Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till <strong>we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Before the final judgments, God's servants receive His "seal" on their foreheads. If God's seal is spiritual (representing His character and commandments in our minds), then the beast's mark is also spiritual (representing the beast's system in our minds and actions).</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 14:1 (KJV)</span>
                "And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, <strong>having his Father's name written in their foreheads</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The 144,000 have God's name written on their foreheads. This clearly isn't literal writing - it means they have God's character, His truth, and His law (including the true Sabbath) sealed in their minds. This is the opposite of the beast's mark.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 22:4 (KJV)</span>
                "And they shall see his face; and <strong>his name shall be in their foreheads</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In the new earth, the saved have God's name on their foreheads. Since heaven is perfect and spiritual, this proves the "forehead mark" language is symbolic throughout Revelation - representing spiritual allegiance, not physical marks.</p>

            <h3>The Two Locations Explained:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forehead (Mind/Thoughts):</strong> Represents conscious choice, intellectual acceptance, and belief. Those marked in the forehead willingly accept and believe the beast's false teachings, choosing human tradition over God's Word.</li>
                <li><strong>Hand (Actions/Works):</strong> Represents outward compliance and behavior. Those marked in the hand may not fully believe the system, but they conform through their actions due to economic pressure, social convenience, or fear of persecution.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Both locations are symbolic:</strong> The forehead = what you think/believe, the hand = what you do. The mark isn't about technology or microchips - it's about whether you choose to obey God's commandments or follow man-made religious traditions.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>The Mark is About Worship and Obedience</h2>

            <p>When we read Revelation 13 carefully, we see the mark is fundamentally connected to worship - who will you worship and obey?</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 13:4 (KJV)</span>
                "And they <strong>worshipped the dragon</strong> which gave power unto the beast: and they <strong>worshipped the beast</strong>, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?"
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The people don't just follow the beast politically or economically - they WORSHIP it. This reveals the mark is a religious issue at its core. It's about false worship versus true worship of God.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 13:8 (KJV)</span>
                "And all that dwell upon the earth <strong>shall worship him</strong>, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Universal worship is enforced - everyone whose name isn't in the Book of Life will worship the beast. The mark therefore separates worshipers into two groups: those who worship God (sealed with His seal) and those who worship the beast (marked with his mark).</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 13:15 (KJV)</span>
                "And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as <strong>would not worship the image of the beast should be killed</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Death penalty for refusing to worship! This shows the mark isn't something you accidentally receive. It's a deliberate choice about worship that results in persecution for those who refuse. You must actively choose: worship God or worship the beast system.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 14:9-11 (KJV)</span>
                "And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, <strong>If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark</strong> in his forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and <strong>they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image</strong>, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Notice the connection: "worship the beast" = "receive his mark". The mark is inseparable from worship. God's severest warning in all Scripture is against receiving this mark, because it means choosing to worship a false system over the true God. The phrase "no rest day nor night" is significant - the lost have rejected God's true rest day (the Sabbath), choosing instead the beast's counterfeit day of worship.</p>

            <h3>False Worship vs. True Worship</h3>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Matthew 15:8-9 (KJV)</span>
                "This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But <strong>in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Jesus condemns worship that replaces God's commandments with human traditions. This is exactly what the beast system does - it changes God's law and demands worship based on human authority rather than biblical truth. Any worship that contradicts God's Word is vain (worthless).</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 14:7 (KJV)</span>
                "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and <strong>worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> God's final call to the world emphasizes worship of the Creator. This language directly echoes the Fourth Commandment (Exodus 20:11), which establishes the seventh-day Sabbath as the memorial of Creation. True worship acknowledges God as Creator by keeping His holy Sabbath day. The mark of the beast represents false worship through a counterfeit day.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">John 4:23-24 (KJV)</span>
                "But the hour cometh, and now is, when the <strong>true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth</strong>: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him <strong>must worship him in spirit and in truth</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> True worship must be according to TRUTH - not tradition, not convenience, not majority opinion. God's truth is His Word (John 17:17). If His Word says the seventh day is the Sabbath, but a religious system changes it to another day, worshiping on that changed day is not "in truth," even if done sincerely.</p>

            <h3>Obeying God vs. Obeying Man</h3>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Acts 5:29 (KJV)</span>
                "Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, <strong>We ought to obey God rather than men</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When human laws or religious traditions contradict God's commands, Christians must choose God's authority over human authority. The mark of the beast represents the ultimate test of this principle: Will you obey God's unchanged Sabbath commandment, or will you follow human religious authority's changed day of worship?</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">James 4:17 (KJV)</span>
                "Therefore to him that <strong>knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Once someone knows God's truth about His Sabbath, continuing to follow man's tradition becomes sin. The mark will become an issue when people are fully informed and must make a clear choice. Until then, God judges us according to the light we have.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">1 John 2:4 (KJV)</span>
                "He that saith, I know him, and <strong>keepeth not his commandments, is a liar</strong>, and the truth is not in him."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> We cannot claim to love God while knowingly disobeying His commandments. If we know the fourth commandment says "Remember the sabbath day" (the seventh day), but choose to keep a different day because of tradition, we're not truly keeping His commandments. The mark forces this issue to the forefront.</p>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>The Core Issue:</strong> The mark of the beast is fundamentally about <strong>WORSHIP</strong> and <strong>OBEDIENCE</strong>. Who will you worship - the Creator or the creature? Whose commands will you follow - God's Word or man's traditions? Will you keep the day God blessed and sanctified, or the day man has substituted?

                <li><strong>666:</strong> Triple 6 = Complete human system pretending to be divine, but always falling short (never reaching 7)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Human Authority Claiming Divine Power</h3>
            <div class="key-point">
                666 represents a <strong>human system</strong> that:

                    <li>Sets itself up as God</li>
                    <li>Changes God's eternal law</li>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Historical Identification:</strong><br>
                Throughout history, Bible scholars have identified this power as the <strong>Papacy/Roman Catholic Church system</strong> based on:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gematria (Letter Values):</strong> The Latin title "VICARIUS FILII DEI" (Vicar of the Son of God) - when Roman numerals are added: V(5) + I(1) + C(100) + A(0) + R(0) + I(1) + U/V(5) + S(0) + F(0) + I(1) + L(50) + I(1) + I(1) + D(500) + E(0) + I(1) = <strong>666</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Claims Divine Authority:</strong> The Pope claims to be "Vicar of Christ" - representative of God on earth</li>
                    <li><strong>Changed God's Law:</strong> Officially changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday</li>
                    <li><strong>Admits This Authority:</strong> Catholic sources state: "Sunday is our mark of authority... the church is above the Bible"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>Important Clarification:</strong><br>
                This is about the <strong>SYSTEM and its teachings</strong>, not about individual Catholics who are sincere believers. Many Catholics love Jesus and don't understand these prophecies. God calls honest people everywhere to study His Word.

            <h3>Daniel 7: Ang Gamay nga Sungay</h3>
            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Daniel 7:25 (Ang Biblia 2011)</span>
                "Mosulti siya batok sa Labing Halangdon ug magdaogdaog sa iyang mga balaan. Magplano siya sa pagbag-o sa mga panahon sa pagsimba ug sa balaod. Ihatag sa iyang mga kamot ang mga balaan sa sulod sa tulo ug tunga ka tuig."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Katin-awan:</strong> Kini ang usa sa pinakaimportante nga propesiya sa Daniel. Ang "gamay nga sungay" mao ang usa ka relihiyoso-politikal nga gahum nga (1) Mosulti BATOK sa Dios - nag-claim ug awtoridad nga iya lang sa Dios; (2) Mag-persecute sa tinuod nga mga balaan sa Dios; (3) MOSULAY SA PAG-USAB SA BALAOD SA DIOS - dili lang magsulay, kondili aktwal nga mag-claim nga may gahum siya sa pag-usab sa eternal law sa Dios; (4) Maghari sulod sa "time, times, ug half a time" nga 1,260 ka tuig sa propetikong panahon. Ang pinakaimportante nga kinaiya mao ang pag-usab sa balaod - unsang relihiyosong gahum ang nag-claim nga nausab nila ang balaod sa Dios? Ug unsang bahin sa balaod ang ilang giusab? Ang tubag: ang Sabbath gikan sa ikapito nga adlaw (Sabado) ngadto sa unang adlaw (Domingo).</p>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Mga Kinaiya niining Gahum:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mosulti batok sa Dios</strong> - Nag-claim ug divine authority nga iya lang dapat sa Dios (sama sa pagtawag sa iyang kaugalingon ug "Holy Father" o "Vicar of Christ")</li>
                    <li><strong>Mag-persecute sa mga balaan</strong> - Ang kasaysayan nagpamatuod sa Inquisition nga nagpatay ug mga milyunes nga tinuod nga Kristohanon</li>
                    <li><strong>Mosulay sa pag-usab sa balaod sa Dios</strong> - Kini ang labing mahinungdanon! Nag-claim nga adunay power sa pag-usab sa Ten Commandments</li>
                    <li><strong>Maghari ug 1,260 ka tuig</strong> - Gikan 538 AD hangtod 1798 AD, ang papal power nagdumala sa Europa</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Daniel 8: Gahum nga Nagpadaku sa Iyang Kaugalingon</h3>

                <span class="scripture-ref">Daniel 8:11-12 (Ang Biblia 2011)</span>

Tungod sa paglapas, gihatag sa sungay ang kasundaluhan sa langit ug ang inadlaw nga halad. Gilabay niya ang kamatuoran sa yuta, ug nagmauswagon siya sa tanan niyang gibuhat."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Katin-awan:</strong> Ang gahum nga gihisgutan dili nagpadaku sa iyang kaugalingon batok sa mga tawo lang - nagpadaku siya batok sa "Prinsipe sa kasundaluhan sa langit" nga mao si Jesu-Cristo mismo! Gikuha niya ang "inadlaw nga halad" - kini nagrepresentar sa pag-intercede ni Cristo isip atong High Priest. Giunsa niya pagkuha? Pinaagi sa pag-insert ug human priest (pari) nga nag-claim nga sila ang intermediaries tali sa Dios ug tawo, imbes nga direkta kita ngadto kang Jesus. Ang "templo" gipukan - tinuod nga spirituhanong pagsimba gipulihan sa human ceremonies ug traditions. Ang "kamatuoran gilabay sa yuta" - ang Bibliya gipugngan gikan sa mga tawo, gisundan sa Latin nga dili masabtan, ug gipulihan sa human traditions.</p>

            <h3>Ang Seal sa Dios</h3>
            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Pinadayag 7:2-3 (Ang Biblia 2011)</span>
                "Unya nakita ko ang laing anghel nga naggikan sa sidlakan. Nagdala siya ug patik sa buhing Dios, ug misinggit siya sa kusog nga tingog ngadto sa upat ka anghel nga gihatagan ug gahom sa pagsamad sa yuta ug sa dagat. Miingon siya, 'Ayaw ninyo samari ang yuta, ang dagat, o ang mga kahoy <strong>hangtod nga mamarka namo sa ilang mga agtang ang mga alagad sa atong Dios</strong>.'"
            </div>

            <p><strong>Katin-awan:</strong> Sa wala pa ang katapusang mga paghukom, ang mga alagad sa Dios makadawat sa Iyang "patik" sa ilang mga agtang. Kini nga patik nagprotektar kanila gikan sa mga kalamidad nga moabot. Kung ang patik sa Dios espirituhanon (nagrepresentar sa Iyang kinaiya ug mga sugo sa atong mga hunahuna), nan ang marka sa mananap espirituhanon usab (nagrepresentar sa sistema sa mananap sa atong mga hunahuna ug mga aksyon). Ang kalibutan bahinbahin ngadto sa duha ka grupo: kadtong adunay patik sa Dios ug kadtong adunay marka sa mananap.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Pinadayag 14:1 (Ang Biblia 2011)</span>
                "Unya nakita ko ang Kordero nga nagtindog sa Bukid sa Zion. Uban kaniya ang usa ka gatos kap-atan ug upat ka libo ka tawo nga <strong>adunay sulat sa ilang agtang ang ngalan sa Kordero ug sa iyang Amahan</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Katin-awan:</strong> Ang 144,000 adunay ngalan sa Dios nga gisulat sa ilang mga agtang - dili literal nga pagsulat kondili espirituhanon nga timailhan. Sila adunay kinaiya sa Dios, ang Iyang kamatuoran, ug ang Iyang balaod (lakip ang tinuod nga Sabbath) nga gi-seal sa ilang mga hunahuna. Sila nahimong sama sa Dios sa kinaiya - matinud-anon, mapainubsanon, ug maunongon. Kini ang perpekto nga opposite sa marka sa mananap. Ang ilang pagsaulog sa ika-7 nga adlaw (Sabado) nagpakita nga sila nag-ila sa Dios ingon nga ilang Magbubuhat ug Ginoo.</p>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Ang Seal sa Dios nagrepresentar sa:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pagsunod sa Dios lamang</li>
                    <li>Pagtuman sa TANAN nga mga sugo sa Dios, lakip ang wala mausab nga Sabbath</li>
                    <li>Pagbaton sa ngalan/kinaiya sa Dios nga gisulat sa hunahuna ug kasingkasing</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Dugang Katin-awan:</strong> Ang patik sa Dios dili usa ka pisikal nga butang. Kini nagrepresentar sa kompleto nga pagpasakop sa Dios ug sa Iyang kamatuoran. Kadtong adunay patik sa Dios naghupot sa Iyang mga sugo, lakip na ang ikaupat nga sugo bahin sa Sabbath. Sila nagsaulog sa ika-7 nga adlaw (Sabado) tungod kay kini ang gimando sa Dios, dili tungod sa tradisyon sa tawo. Ang ilang pagsaulog sa tinuod nga Sabbath mao ang visible sign sa ilang pagkamaunongon sa Dios.</p>

            <h3>Ang Pagpili</h3>
            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Pinadayag 14:9-12 (Ang Biblia 2011)</span>
                "Unya misunod ang ikatulong anghel ug miingon nga kusog, 'Bisan kinsa nga <strong>mosimba sa mapintas nga mananap ug sa iyang larawan, ug modawat sa iyang marka</strong> diha sa iyang agtang o sa iyang kamot, mainom usab siya sa puro nga kasuko sa Dios nga gibubo sa kopa sa iyang kapungot. Siya pagaantoson diha sa kalayo ug asupre sa atubangan sa mga balaan nga anghel ug sa Kordero. Ang aso sa ilang pag-antos mosaka hangtod sa kahangtoran. <strong>Walay pahulay adlaw ug gabii ang mga mosimba sa mananap ug sa iyang larawan</strong>, ug ang bisan kinsa nga modawat sa marka sa iyang ngalan.' Dinhi mopakita ang kalig-on sa pagpailob sa mga balaan—<strong>kadtong nagatuman sa mga sugo sa Dios ug nag-una sa pagtuo kang Jesus</strong>."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Katin-awan:</strong> Kini ang labing seryoso nga pasidaan sa tibuok Bibliya! Ang Dios nagpasidaan batok sa pagdawat sa marka tungod kay kini nagpasabot sa pagpili sa pagsimba sa sistema sa mananap imbes sa tinuod nga Dios. Matikdi nga ang teksto nag-ingon "walay pahulay adlaw ug gabii" - kini nagpunting pabalik sa Sabbath (adlaw sa pahulay). Kadtong misalikway sa tinuod nga adlaw sa pahulay sa Dios (Sabado) ug mipili sa imbis nga adlaw (Domingo) wala na nila makuha ang tinuod nga espirituhanon nga pahulay. Sa katapusan, ang kalibutan magbahinbahin ngadto sa duha: (1) kadtong nagtuman sa TANANG mga sugo sa Dios lakip ang Sabbath, ug (2) kadtong misunod sa tradisyon sa tawo ug mipili sa giusab nga adlaw.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Pinadayag 22:14 (Ang Biblia 2011)</span>
                "Bulahan ang mga <strong>nagtuman sa iyang mga sugo</strong>! Makasulod sila sa ganghaan sa siyudad ug makakaon sa bunga sa kahoy sa kinabuhi."
            </div>

            <p><strong>Katin-awan:</strong> Ang katapusang blessings alang lamang sa mga nagtuman sa TANANG mga sugo sa Dios. Dili pwede nga pilion lang unsay atong gusto nga sundon. Ang ikaupat nga sugo (Sabbath) pareho ra ka importante sa ubang mga sugo. Ang pagsaulog sa tinuod nga Sabbath usa ka timailhan sa pagtuman sa bug-os nga balaod sa Dios, dili lang ang bahin lamang.</p>

            </div>

            <p><strong>Katin-awan:</strong> Ang Dios nagtawag sa Iyang katawhan nga mogawas gikan sa Babilonia (ang bakak nga relihiyosong sistema). Kini usa ka tawag sa paghigawas - dili tawag sa pagdumot. Daghan nga matinud-anon, mahigugmaon nga mga Kristohanon anaa pa sulod sa mga organisasyong adunay mga bakak nga doctrina. Ang Dios nagtawag kanila nga mogawas ug mosunod sa TINUOD nga kamatuoran sa Bibliya, dili sa tradisyon. Ang tawag dili sa pag-attack sa ubang mga tawo, kondili sa paghigugma kanila pinaagi sa pagpakigbahin sa kamatuoran.</p>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Pinadayag 14:7 (Ang Biblia 2011)</span>
                "Miingon siya nga kusog, 'Kahadloki ang Dios ug tahora siya, kay moabot na ang panahon sa paghukom. <strong>Simbaon ninyo siya nga Magbubuhat sa langit ug sa yuta, sa dagat ug sa mga tuboran sa tubig</strong>.'"
            </div>

            <p><strong>Katin-awan:</strong> Ang katapusang mensahe sa Dios sa kalibutan nag-emphasize sa pagsimba sa Magbubuhat. Kini nga pinulongan direktang gikan sa ikaupat nga sugo (Exodo 20:11): "Kay sa unom ka adlaw gibuhat ni Yahweh ang langit ug ang yuta, ang dagat ug ang tanan nga anaa kanila." Ang pagsimba sa Magbubuhat nagpasabot sa pag-ila nga Siya ang nagbuhat sa tanan ug ang Iyang Sabbath mao ang memorial niini nga paglalang. Ang tinuod nga pagsimba sa Magbubuhat gipakita pinaagi sa pagsaulog sa Iyang Sabbath - ang ika-7 nga adlaw nga Iyang gipanalanginan ug gibalaan.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin: 20px 0;">
                <strong>Importante nga Koneksyon:</strong> Matikdi nga ang Pinadayag 14:7 nag-echo sa Sabbath commandment (Exodus 20:11): "Kay sa unom ka adlaw gibuhat ni Yahweh ang langit ug ang yuta, ang dagat ug ang tanan nga anaa kanila, ug mipahulay sa ikapito nga adlaw." Ang Sabbath mao ang memorial sa paglalang - ang timailhan nga kita gibuhat sa Dios ug dili nahimo pinaagi sa evolution o accident. Ang pagbalhin sa Sabbath gikan sa Sabado ngadto sa Domingo usa ka pagsalikway sa kini nga memorial. Kini mao ang reason ngano nga ang Sabbath mahimong sentro sa katapusang away tali sa kamatuoran ug bakak, tali sa Dios ug Satanas.
