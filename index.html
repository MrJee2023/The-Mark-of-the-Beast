            <h2>What is the Mark of the Beast?</h2>
            
            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 13:16-17 (KJV)</span>
                "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name."
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Important:</strong> The mark of the beast is NOT a physical chip or tattoo. It is a <strong>symbolic mark</strong> representing allegiance to a religious-political system that opposes God's commandments.
            </div>

            <h3>Biblical Pattern: Forehead and Hand Are Symbolic</h3>
            
            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Deuteronomy 6:6-8 (KJV)</span>
                "And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart... And thou shalt <strong>bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes</strong>."
            </div>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Deuteronomy 11:18 (KJV)</span>
                "Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and <strong>bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes</strong>."
            </div>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Exodus 13:9 (KJV)</span>
                "And it shall be for <strong>a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes</strong>, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt."
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>God uses "mark on hand/forehead" language symbolically throughout the Bible:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Forehead (between eyes):</strong> Thoughts, beliefs, mental acceptance</li>
                    <li><strong>Hand:</strong> Actions, work, deeds</li>
                    <li>This is clearly symbolic - God never commanded literal bands on foreheads!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>God's Seal vs. Beast's Mark - Both on Forehead</h3>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Ezekiel 9:4 (KJV)</span>
                "And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and <strong>set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations</strong> that be done in the midst thereof."
            </div>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 22:4 (KJV)</span>
                "And they shall see his face; and <strong>his name shall be in their foreheads</strong>."
            </div>

            <p>In heaven, the saved have God's name on their foreheads - clearly this is spiritual, not physical!</p>

            <h3>The Two Locations Explained:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forehead (Mind):</strong> Conscious choice and intellectual acceptance - believing the false system is correct</li>
                <li><strong>Hand (Action):</strong> Outward compliance through actions - following the system even without full belief, due to pressure, fear, or economic necessity</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-card">
            <h2>The Mark is About Worship</h2>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 13:4, 8 (KJV)</span>
                "And they <strong>worshipped the dragon</strong> which gave power unto the beast: and they <strong>worshipped the beast</strong>, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?... And all that dwell upon the earth <strong>shall worship him</strong>, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
            </div>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Revelation 13:15 (KJV)</span>
                "And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as <strong>would not worship the image of the beast should be killed</strong>."
            </div>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>The Core Issue:</strong> The mark of the beast is fundamentally about <strong>WORSHIP</strong>. Who will you worship - the Creator or the creature? Who will you obey - God's commandments or man's traditions?
            </div>

            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">Matthew 15:9 (KJV)</span>
                "But in vain they do worship me, <strong>teaching for doctrines the commandments of men</strong>."
            </div>

                <span class="scripture-ref">Acts 5:29 (KJV)</span>
                "Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, <strong>We ought to obey God rather than men</strong>."

            <h3>1. The Number of Man</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Number 6:</strong> Man was created on the 6th day (Genesis 1:27-31)</li>
                <li><strong>Number 7:</strong> God's perfect number - the 7th day Sabbath, completion</li>
                <li><strong>666:</strong> Triple 6 = Complete human system pretending to be divine, but always falling short (never reaching 7)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Human Authority Claiming Divine Power</h3>
            <div class="key-point">
                666 represents a <strong>human system</strong> that:
                <ul>
                    <li>Claims divine authority</li>
                    <li>Sets itself up as God</li>
                    <li>Changes God's eternal law</li>
                    <li>Demands worship and obedience due only to God</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Blasphemy Defined</h3>
            <div class="scripture">
                <span class="scripture-ref">John 10:33 (KJV)</span>
                "The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God."
            </div>

            <p>Blasphemy = A human claiming to be God or claiming God's prerogatives (like changing His eternal law)</p>

            <div class="key-point">
                <strong>Historical Identification:</strong><br>
                Throughout history, Bible scholars have identified this power as the <strong>Papacy/Roman Catholic Church system</strong> based on:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gematria (Letter Values):</strong> The Latin title "VICARIUS FILII DEI" (Vicar of the Son of God) - when Roman numerals are added: V(5) + I(1) + C(100) + A(0) + R(0) + I(1) + U/V(5) + S(0) + F(0) + I(1) + L(50) + I(1) + I(1) + D(500) + E(0) + I(1) = <strong>666</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Claims Divine Authority:</strong> The Pope claims to be "Vicar of Christ" - representative of God on earth</li>
                    <li><strong>Changed God's Law:</strong> Officially changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday</li>
                    <li><strong>Admits This Authority:</strong> Catholic sources state: "Sunday is our mark of authority... the church is above the Bible"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>Important Clarification:</strong><br>
                This is about the <strong>SYSTEM and its teachings</strong>, not about individual Catholics who are sincere believers. Many Catholics love Jesus and don't understand these prophecies. God calls honest people everywhere to study His Word.

                    <li><strong>Gematria (Letter Values):</strong> Ang Latin title nga "VICARIUS FILII DEI" (Vicar of the Son of God) - kung i-add ang Roman numerals: V(5) + I(1) + C(100) + A(0) + R(0) + I(1) + U/V(5) + S(0) + F(0) + I(1) + L(50) + I(1) + I(1) + D(500) + E(0) + I(1) = <strong>666</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Nag-claim ug Divine Authority:</strong> Ang Papa nag-claim nga siya "Vicar of Christ" - representative sa Dios sa yuta</li>
                    <li><strong>Nag-usab sa Balaod sa Dios:</strong> Opisyal nga giusab ang Sabbath gikan sa Sabado ngadto sa Domingo</li>
                    <li><strong>Nag-admit niining Awtoridad:</strong> Ang Catholic sources nagsulti: "Ang Sunday mao ang among marka sa awtoridad... ang simbahan mas taas pa sa Bibliya"</li>

                The mark of the beast isn't about technology or physical marks. It's about <strong>WORSHIP</strong> and <strong>OBEDIENCE</strong>.
                <br><br>
                <strong>The Question:</strong> Will you follow human tradition and changed laws, or will you remain faithful to God's unchanged commandments?

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>This is not about hating any group of people.</strong> Many sincere, loving Christians are in various churches and don't yet understand these prophecies. God is calling all honest hearts to study His Word and follow truth wherever it leads.
